        "The Prefill Bottleneck In Large Language Model (LLM) inference is that every request begins with a prefill phase, where the model \"reads\" and processes the entire input prompt to generate its internal mathematical representation, known as the KV (Key-Value) Cache. When multiple users interact with the same long document, or when an AI agent sends a repeated \"System Prompt\" (e.g., a 2,000-token instruction set) with every query, the GPU is forced to redundantly re-calculate the same KV cache for that shared text every single time.\n",
        "\n",
        "This bottleneck is caused by the stateless nature of standard transformers, which lack a native \"memory\" of previous computations. This results in high latency, wasted compute cycles, and significant energy inefficiency, especially as context windows grow into the tens of thousands of tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The Solution: Automatic Prefix Caching (APC) Prefix Caching solves this by treating the KV cache as a reusable asset. Using a technique like **PagedAttention**, the engine partitions the KV cache into fixed-size blocks and stores them in GPU memory. When a new request arrives, the engine performs a cryptographic hash of the input tokens; if the \"prefix\" matches a hash already stored in memory, the model skips the prefill computation entirely for that segment. It simply \"points\" to the existing memory blocks and moves directly to the decode phase (generating new text).\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, the server that hosts the LLM keeps track of as many previous KV-cache blocks as possible, using the Least Recently Used method. These blocks and hashes also do not need to be seperated by user, as the hashes match if that section of the prompt matches. This saves a lot of computation. Below, it performed roughly 10% better on less than 4,000 tokens.\n"

This initial reading phase is called the prefill. For large prompts the prefill requires a burst of GPU computation. In standard systems, this creates a stall where the GPU is 100% occupied with reading a new request and cannot generate tokens for any other active requests. If multiple users are on the same GPU, one person’s giant document can effectively freeze the experience for everyone else, leading to jerky, inconsistent output speeds and high latency.\n",

Between these chunks, the GPU can \"context switch\" to perform other work, such as generating the next token for a different user. If another person's prompt is less than 512 tokens, theirs can get an answer between the larger prompt.\n",

        "In standard inference, a model must perform a full forward pass to generate every single token, which is often bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. N-gram speculation solves this by predicting that the model will repeat sequences it has already generated within the current prompt. It works by maintaining a local window of recently generated tokens and searching the previous context for matches. When a matching \"n-gram\" (a sequence of n tokens) is found, the system \"speculates\" that the tokens following that previous occurrence will appear again. These speculated tokens are then verified by the LLM in a single parallel forward pass. If the speculation is correct, the model can \"produce\" multiple tokens in the time it would usually take to generate one; if incorrect, the model simply reverts to its standard output with negligible computational overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that the large LLM one can go through these newly generated tokens in a single forward pass, by treating them as part of the original prompt and applying a causal attention mask to it to generate probabilities of what it (the larger model) would have generated at each point. If the tokens match, it is accepted. If they don't, the probability distribution of the larger LLM decides the token (taking temperature, etc. into account), and the rest of the newly generated ones are discarded. Then the smaller model predicts once again.\n",

With good models, this can achieve an accuracy of more than 50%, saving a lot of time and compute by not needing the target LLM to produce these tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "These newly predicted candidates are then passed to the large target model, which verifies the entire batch in a single, parallel forward pass. This process, often combined with rejection sampling, ensures that the final output remains identical in quality to what the large model would have produced alone.\n",

        "It is important to note that the large LLM one can go through these newly generated tokens in a single forward pass, by treating them as part of the original prompt and applying a causal attention mask to it to generate probabilities of what it (the larger model) would have generated at each point. If the tokens match, it is accepted. If they don't, the probability distribution of the larger LLM decides the token (taking temperature etc into account), and the rest of the newly generated ones are discarded. Then the smaller model predicts once again."
